spaCy's CLI provides a range of helpful commands for downloading and training
pipelines, converting data and debugging your config, data and installation. For
a list of available commands, you can type `python -m spacy --help`. You can
also add the `--help` flag to any command or subcommand to see the description,
available arguments and usage.

## project {id="project",version="3"}

The `spacy project` CLI includes subcommands for working with
[spaCy projects](/usage/projects), end-to-end workflows for building and
deploying custom spaCy pipelines.

### project clone {id="project-clone",tag="command"}

Clone a project template from a Git repository. Calls into `git` under the hood
and can use the sparse checkout feature if available, so you're only downloading
what you need. By default, spaCy's
[project templates repo](https://github.com/explosion/projects) is used, but you
can provide any other repo (public or private) that you have access to using the
`--repo` option.

```bash
$ python -m spacy project clone [name] [dest] [--repo] [--branch] [--sparse]
```

> #### Example
>
> ```bash
> $ python -m spacy project clone pipelines/ner_wikiner
> ```
>
> Clone from custom repo:
>
> ```bash
> $ python -m spacy project clone template --repo https://github.com/your_org/your_repo
> ```

| Name             | Description                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`           | The name of the template to clone, relative to the repo. Can be a top-level directory or a subdirectory like `dir/template`. ~~str (positional)~~         |
| `dest`           | Where to clone the project. Defaults to current working directory. ~~Path (positional)~~                                                                  |
| `--repo`, `-r`   | The repository to clone from. Can be any public or private Git repo you have access to. ~~str (option)~~                                                  |
| `--branch`, `-b` | The branch to clone from. Defaults to `master`. ~~str (option)~~                                                                                          |
| `--sparse`, `-S` | Enable [sparse checkout](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-sparse-checkout) to only check out and download what's needed. Requires Git v22.2+. ~~bool (flag)~~ |
| `--help`, `-h`   | Show help message and available arguments. ~~bool (flag)~~                                                                                                |
| **CREATES**      | The cloned [project directory](/usage/projects#project-files).                                                                                            |

### project assets {id="project-assets",tag="command"}

Fetch project assets like datasets and pretrained weights. Assets are defined in
the `assets` section of the [`project.yml`](/usage/projects#project-yml). If a
`checksum` is provided, the file is only downloaded if no local file with the
same checksum exists and spaCy will show an error if the checksum of the
downloaded file doesn't match. If assets don't specify a `url` they're
considered "private" and you have to take care of putting them into the
destination directory yourself. If a local path is provided, the asset is copied
into the current project.

```bash
$ python -m spacy project assets [project_dir]
```

> #### Example
>
> ```bash
> $ python -m spacy project assets [--sparse]
> ```

| Name                                           | Description                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `project_dir`                                  | Path to project directory. Defaults to current working directory. ~~Path (positional)~~                                                                   |
| `--extra`, `-e` <Tag variant="new">3.3.1</Tag> | Download assets marked as "extra". Default false. ~~bool (flag)~~                                                                                         |
| `--sparse`, `-S`                               | Enable [sparse checkout](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-sparse-checkout) to only check out and download what's needed. Requires Git v22.2+. ~~bool (flag)~~ |
| `--help`, `-h`                                 | Show help message and available arguments. ~~bool (flag)~~                                                                                                |
| **CREATES**                                    | Downloaded or copied assets defined in the `project.yml`.                                                                                                 |

### project run {id="project-run",tag="command"}

Run a named command or workflow defined in the
[`project.yml`](/usage/projects#project-yml). If a workflow name is specified,
all commands in the workflow are run, in order. If commands define
[dependencies or outputs](/usage/projects#deps-outputs), they will only be
re-run if state has changed. For example, if the input dataset changes, a
preprocessing command that depends on those files will be re-run.

```bash
$ python -m spacy project run [subcommand] [project_dir] [--force] [--dry]
```

> #### Example
>
> ```bash
> $ python -m spacy project run train
> ```

| Name            | Description                                                                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `subcommand`    | Name of the command or workflow to run. ~~str (positional)~~                            |
| `project_dir`   | Path to project directory. Defaults to current working directory. ~~Path (positional)~~ |
| `--force`, `-F` | Force re-running steps, even if nothing changed. ~~bool (flag)~~                        |
| `--dry`, `-D`   | Perform a dry run and don't execute scripts. ~~bool (flag)~~                            |
| `--help`, `-h`  | Show help message and available arguments. ~~bool (flag)~~                              |
| **EXECUTES**    | The command defined in the `project.yml`.                                               |

### project push {id="project-push",tag="command"}

Upload all available files or directories listed as in the `outputs` section of
commands to a remote storage. Outputs are archived and compressed prior to
upload, and addressed in the remote storage using the output's relative path
(URL encoded), a hash of its command string and dependencies, and a hash of its
file contents. This means `push` should **never overwrite** a file in your
remote. If all the hashes match, the contents are the same and nothing happens.
If the contents are different, the new version of the file is uploaded. Deleting
obsolete files is left up to you.

Remotes can be defined in the `remotes` section of the
[`project.yml`](/usage/projects#project-yml). Under the hood, spaCy uses
[`Pathy`](https://github.com/justindujardin/pathy) to communicate with the
remote storages, so you can use any protocol that `Pathy` supports, including
[S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/),
[Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage), and the local
filesystem, although you may need to install extra dependencies to use certain
protocols.

```bash
$ python -m spacy project push [remote] [project_dir]
```

> #### Example
>
> ```bash
> $ python -m spacy project push my_bucket
> ```
>
> ```yaml
> ### project.yml
> remotes:
>   my_bucket: 's3://my-spacy-bucket'
> ```

| Name           | Description                                                                             |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `remote`       | The name of the remote to upload to. Defaults to `"default"`. ~~str (positional)~~      |
| `project_dir`  | Path to project directory. Defaults to current working directory. ~~Path (positional)~~ |
| `--help`, `-h` | Show help message and available arguments. ~~bool (flag)~~                              |
| **UPLOADS**    | All project outputs that exist and are not already stored in the remote.                |

### project pull {id="project-pull",tag="command"}

Download all files or directories listed as `outputs` for commands, unless they
are already present locally. When searching for files in the remote, `pull`
won't just look at the output path, but will also consider the **command
string** and the **hashes of the dependencies**. For instance, let's say you've
previously pushed a checkpoint to the remote, but now you've changed some
hyper-parameters. Because you've changed the inputs to the command, if you run
`pull`, you won't retrieve the stale result. If you train your pipeline and push
the outputs to the remote, the outputs will be saved alongside the prior
outputs, so if you change the config back, you'll be able to fetch back the
result.

Remotes can be defined in the `remotes` section of the
[`project.yml`](/usage/projects#project-yml). Under the hood, spaCy uses
[`Pathy`](https://github.com/justindujardin/pathy) to communicate with the

> ```
>
> ```yaml
> ### project.yml

| Name           | Description                                                                             |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `remote`       | The name of the remote to download from. Defaults to `"default"`. ~~str (positional)~~  |
| `project_dir`  | Path to project directory. Defaults to current working directory. ~~Path (positional)~~ |
| `--help`, `-h` | Show help message and available arguments. ~~bool (flag)~~                              |
| **DOWNLOADS**  | All project outputs that do not exist locally and can be found in the remote.           |

### project document {id="project-document",tag="command"}

Auto-generate a pretty Markdown-formatted `README` for your project, based on
its [`project.yml`](/usage/projects#project-yml). Will create sections that
document the available commands, workflows and assets. The auto-generated
content will be placed between two hidden markers, so you can add your own
custom content before or after the auto-generated documentation. When you re-run
the `project document` command, only the auto-generated part is replaced.

```bash
$ python -m spacy project document [project_dir] [--output] [--no-emoji]
```

> #### Example
>
> ```bash
> $ python -m spacy project document --output README.md
> ```

### project dvc {id="project-dvc",tag="command"}

Auto-generate [Data Version Control](https://dvc.org) (DVC) config file. Calls
[`dvc run`](https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/run) with `--no-exec` under
the hood to generate the `dvc.yaml`. A DVC project can only define one pipeline,
so you need to specify one workflow defined in the
[`project.yml`](/usage/projects#project-yml). If no workflow is specified, the
first defined workflow is used. The DVC config will only be updated if the
`project.yml` changed. For details, see the
[DVC integration](/usage/projects#dvc) docs.

<Infobox variant="warning">

This command requires DVC to be installed and initialized in the project
directory, e.g. via [`dvc init`](https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/init).
You'll also need to add the assets you want to track with
[`dvc add`](https://dvc.org/doc/command-reference/add).
